# So you want to contribute to my little project...

## Bug Reports

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/raging-loon/Simula-24/issues).

## Development

C++20 and CMake the primary tools in this project.

### Pull Requests
Steps for submitting a pull request
1. Fork the Repo
2. Make a new branch based off of the current dev branch
    a. `git switch -c <new branch>`
    b. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/raging-loon/Simula-24`
    c. `git fetch upstream`
3. Make your changes + tests
4. Make sure your changes actually work
5. Run the unit test build
6. Submit a pull request. Be clear with your description.
7. Wait
7. Wait some more
8. Pat yourself on the back for making an OSS contribution. Linus would be proud.9. Delete your local branch
    a. `git branch -D <new branch>`
10. Rebase with the current dev branch
    b. `git pull --rebase upstream <current dev branch>`
### General

- 4 spaces - make sure your editor replaces tabs with spaces
- Allman Style Bracing. Each brace should have its own line. 
    Not as picky with namespace declarations but try to keep it Allman.
- Header guards should be the full path to the file from the /simula24 directory.
    -   E.g. `/simula24/core/stl/array.h` would have the header guard `CORE_STL_ARRAY_H_`
- *Absolutely no explicit multiple inheritance or I will slash your tires*
    -  Multiple inheritence causes many many more problems than it solves. 
    -  Consider using composition or re-thinking your design instead
- NO C++ STL. Except for `<type_traits>`
    - Use the Simula Template Library instead (`core/stl`)
    - Exceptions can be made until an appropriate template class is made for what ever you are doing
- No exceptions
    - Favor return codes/booleans instead

### Documentation
We are using Doxygen to generate documentation. 
Make sure every 
- Class
- Function
- Variable
- Macro
Is appropriately documented. Exceptions are those that are inherently self-documenting

Use '@' instead of '\' for doxygen commands.

### Unit Testing

For Visual Studio, change the build to 'x64-unit-test' and run it.

For everything else, add the `-DENABLE_TESTS=YES` to your CMake command when building.
